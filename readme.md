# Database Server Tech Test

This program should: 
* create a server that is accessible on http://localhost:4000/
* When it receives a SET request on http://localhost:4000/set?somekey=somevalue should store the key value pair in memory
* When it receieves a GET request on http://localhost:4000/get?key=somekey it should return the value stored at somekey
* This data is stored in memory.
* At some point (not now) it will need to have a database added
